## How this project works

The [AWS DevOps Bootcamp](https://www.skool.com/cloudtalents/about) is a training with a project-first approach.

This means that participants learn by building projects instead of watching videos.

But instead of building various simple and disconnected projects, they work on hands-on assignments that take an application from MVP to production-ready.

And this application is one of them.

It's used as the basis for the EC2 section of the bootcamp.

The [main repository](https://github.com/cloudtalents/fictitious-startup-v1) provides participants with a MVP version of the application.

Participants fork the main repository and work on the assignments until the application reaches a more mature state.

The goal is to give them the opportunity of following the whole lifecycle of an server-based application.

The bootcamp can be found here: [AWS DevOps Bootcamp](https://www.skool.com/cloudtalents/about)
